== Abstract

Jenkins Ambassadors are influential Jenkins enthusiasts who have the passion to share their Jenkins technical expertise with others.
Ambassadors help to further the project by helping the community to understand how to use Jenkins and what makes Jenkins powerful.

They are experts in one or more areas related to Jenkins are passionate about sharing their Jenkins knowledge with others.
Jenkins Ambassadors are volunteer representatives (not employees), leaders in the Jenkins community committed to sharing their Jenkins expertise.
No matter how they contribute -
whether they are blogging, writing books, speaking, creating tutorials and classes,
offering support in forums, or organizing and contributing to JAMs and other events –
they help make Jenkins better.

=== Term

* This is an annual position


=== How are Jenkins Ambassador selected?

The Jenkins Ambassador program is Jenkins Community program sponsored by CloudBees.
However, the program is not a CloudBees promotional program.
Care will be taken to avoid CloudBees favoritism or even the appearance of such.
The program will be largely self-governing with members making most decisions.
CloudBees employees may be Ambassadors.
There is no set limit to the number or percentage of CB employees that can be Ambassadors (however, see avoiding favoritism above).

Jenkins Ambassadors operate as an independent group who use a consensus review process to select new members.
All communication and discussion are conducted via the TBD (a public) mailing list.
Jenkins Ambassadors receive via an email, the nominee's information based on the criteria above.
Voting to select the nominee happens via the mailing list with either +1 or -1 from the peer group over a two-week period.
If the nominee receives three +1 votes and zero negative votes by the end of two weeks then that person is confirmed as a Jenkins Ambassador.
If there is a -1 vote then this triggers a discussion after which the negative vote may or may not be changed. If the negative vote remains, the nominee cannot be confirmed.
If there are less than three +1 votes during the two-week voting period then further discussion needs to be encouraged.

If there are less than three Ambassadors, the following Jenkins project contributors may cast votes:

* Kohsuke Kawaguchi
* R. Tyler Croy
* Alyssa Tong
* Daniel Beck



== Motivation

With the establishment of Jenkins Area meetup (JAMs),
the Jenkins community has grown vastly all over the world.
This growth has brought together novice, intermediate, to advanced users.
Each level of users has a unique need for Jenkins knowledge
and there aren’t enough Jenkins ‘educators’.
The document creates a program foster a stronger Jenkins community by recognizing
contributors that are both experts in one or more topics related to Jenkins
and active members of the community who make the effort to help the community.

== Reasoning

=== No hard limit on CloudBees employees

A hard limit of 10% or less are CB employees was considered,
but rejected due to concerns about fairness and added complexity.


=== Open Questions

==== Should there be a limit of certain # of ambassadors at a given time? Maybe 20 Ambassadors a year?

==== What if Ambassador(s) do not vote in good faith or otherwise act to exclude candidates on personal grounds? 

Does it mean that any Jenkins Ambassador can block all candidates from being elected during his/her term? Does not look good, people may go negative and toxic sometimes. I would rather prefer to see a vote override engine in this JEP.

==== Which certifications? Jenkins ones or what?

==== Use the term "Jenkins Board members and officers" instead of specific list of back vote casters?


==== How are potential Ambassadors found and nominated?

Ideas:
* Look at JAM Organizer list?
* Ask contributors during IRC meeting for suggestions
* Once there is a group of Jenkins Ambassadors in place those Ambassadors can
decide for themselves?
